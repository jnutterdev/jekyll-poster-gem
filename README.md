### A Simple gem file for generating a Jekyll post

The format of the exported post file will combine the date and title of the post to create the markdown file, and then insert frontmatter with something that looks like the following:

```
---
layout: post
title: 
date: YYYY-MM-DD 00:00:00 -0000
tags:
published: true
---```
